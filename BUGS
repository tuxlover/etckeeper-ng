# #5 when using -f somtimes getting this:
#fatal: Not a git repository (or any parent up to mount parent )
#Stopping at filesystem boundary (GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set).
#FIXME:
# using rsync should have options to handle symclinks propertly we should look
# this up in the manpage
# basicly what to do here is whenever a symlink is found not backup the symlink
# but rather backup the file. and vice versa when resetting and a symlink is found
# write to the target to the symlink and do not overwrite the symlink with the file
#
# #8 In systemd the targets are linked to lib we need a special handling for this
#
# #11 restore for permission during check does not work
#FIXME: when changing permissions and checking in these changes we need 
# to make a new commit everytime this happens to store this permanently
#
# #23 check_perms module when check in permssions these should trigger a new rsync
